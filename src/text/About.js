const about = "Natalie Laura Mering (born June 11, 1988), known professionally as Weyes Blood (pronounced /waɪzblʌd/), is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. She was primarily raised in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. She began her career in the underground noise music scene, first as bassist of the Portland, Oregon-based group Jackie-O Motherfucker, and then with the Baltimore-based group Nautical Almanac. Mering subsequently began recording her own material under variations of the name Weyes Blood, inspired by Flannery O’Connor's 1952 novel Wise Blood. After her self-released debut album, The Outside Room (2011), she signed with the independent label Mexican Summer, releasing The Innocents (2014) and Front Row Seat to Earth (2016). She released her fourth studio album, Titanic Rising (2019) on Sub Pop, to critical acclaim."
